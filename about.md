## Background

I come from a rather poor family. My parents were better off than theirs but it wasn't always easy. I was raised by a single mother who was a police officer in Philadelphia. She worked all the time. 

That meant I had to grow up. 

I started helping with yard work early and then quickly transitioned into helping with basic tasks at my uncle's construction company - I worked on and off with him through college. It started off as mowing lawns but ended with some team management and control over jobs and a small crew. I don't miss that life but it did teach me how to work - and work efficiently.

## West Chester University
During college I was an average student at best. I spent more time relaxing and playing video games than I did in the library - I was never good at studying. I managed to graduate with a 3.2 GPA but failed to have any internships. 

## Corporate Salesforce Trainer at Revature
After graduation, I was without any glimspe of a job offer. I had begun Ubering and was getting ready to make the transition back to manual labor. Luckily for me I heard back from [Revature](revature.com). Like thousands of others, Revature's bootcamp gave me the platform I needed to enter the Software Engineering field as a Salesforce Developer. I finished at the top of my class and was offered an internal position to become a Corporate Trainer.

Within 6 months I became one of Revature's top Corporate Trainers. Being a Salesforce Trainer required working around the clock to ensure my team was successful and our clients were happy. Along with a great team, we were able to completely restructure the Salesforce curriculum to ensure a [successful](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/revature_revature-becomes-a-trailhead-academy-authorized-activity-6668154566971797505-9cKd) partnership with Salesforce - representing our team at [Dreamforce](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthew-ruiz-099253116_revature-activity-6600111401044369409-PdsE) both on the sales-floor and in client meetings.

After 18 months, I had successfully guided over 100 college graduates through a 10-week coding bootcamp. Many of which are mid-senior developers at companies such as Accenture, Deloitte, Infosys, Cognizant, and more. 

In January 2020 I left Revature to find a position with more growth potential. I was strained by tenure and decided it was best elsewhere.

## Mobile Development
After a few rounds of interviews at firms around DC I realized that my passion was not in Salesforce. My heart was in the mobile space. That's because while I was working for Revature, I had been churning out two mobile apps with a friend Dan.

### TeenPros
Launching [TeenPros](teenprofessionals.com) revealed that my passion lies in the mobile-space. I see it as something that allows you to go from idea to product with just yourself. You don't need supply chains or any of that. Just dedication.  

If we were to give titles for sake of giving titles, Dan would be CEO and I would be CTO. This is his baby so he was the one spearheading the effort. We worked together for 18 months to deliver these apps. I had some formal training from Revature so I led most of the technical decisions but it was a team effort. We were both learning mobile development at the time.

We launched TeenPros in March 2020 and have serviced a few dozen users in the South Jersey area.

Version 2 is currently being built in React Native so that we may service both Android and iOS users. Likewise, the transition to Web will be less expensive.

### BoxBets

Since quitting Revature, I have also been working on [BoxBets](boxbetsapp.com). BoxBets was a game friends and I played in college. Mobile development once again has allowed me to share that experience with the world.

I'm about 80% complete and aim to release in September; we're going to target a Philadelphia-area launch.
